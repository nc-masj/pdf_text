  /// set/append the link to its github repo.

  /// 2) The library, does not allow to set the createdTime explicitly,
  /// instead it calls DateTime.now(), preprocesses the result and uses it
  /// to save in the pdf document being created.
  /// For example: If a call to DateTime.now() returns 2020-12-09 23:02:35.861548
  /// the library will save it in the document in the 12 hour format with the
  /// milliseconds part truncated (2020-12-09 11:02:35.000).
  /// Because of that, checks of createdDate in the tests will be omitted as well.
